# Word Suggestions from Keypad

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible valid English words that the number could represent. Return the answer in alphabetical order. 

You are given a list of 10000 English words in the file [english_words.txt](./english_words.txt) which you can use to check if any word is a valid word or not.

See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-fs-readfilesync-method/) to find out how to read files in nodejs.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

### Examples
```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: [
  'ad', 'ae', 'af',
  'bd', 'be', 'cd',
  'ce', 'cf'
]
so if you look at the above input, given keystroke is "23", and we know for 2 in keypad we have a, b, c as the choice similarly for 3 we have d, e, f as the choice. So by combining each possibility alot of words can be formed now to see whether they are valid or not we have to look at english_words.txt and see if formed word exist in it or not.

```
Input: digits = "6463"
Output: [ 'mime', 'mind', 'mine', 'nine' ]
```

```
Input: digits = "43556"
Output: [ 'hello' ]
```
